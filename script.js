/* Problem Statement: Imagine you are developing a student management system for a school. Your task is to create 
a JavaScript program that declares variables to store information about students, such as their names, ages, grades, 
and attendance status.

Task 1: Declare variables to represent student information such as name, age, grade, and attendance status. */

let student_name = "John Doe"
let age = 17
let grade = "12th"
let attendance_status = false

console.log("Task 1:",student_name)
console.log("Task 1:",age)
console.log("Task 1:",grade)
console.log("Task 1:",attendance_status)
// Task 2: Assign sample values to the student information variables.

// Task 2: Assign sample values
// studentName = "Alice";
// studentAge = 15;
// studentGrade = 10;
// isPresent = true;

student_name = "Alice"
age = 15
grade ="10th"
attendance_status = true


// Task 3: Display the student information using console.log() statements.

// Expected Outcomes:

console.log("Task 2:",student_name)
console.log("Task 2:",age)
console.log("Task 2:",grade)
console.log("Task 2:",attendance_status)




// After completing Task 1, students should understand how to declare variables with different data types in JavaScript.
// After completing Task 2, students should be able to assign values to variables of various data types.
// After completing Task 3, students should be able to display variable values using console.log() statements.

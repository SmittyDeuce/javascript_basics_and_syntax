# javascript_basics_and_syntax


## Overview

This project involves developing two basic programs in JavaScript:

1. **Student Management System**: A program to store and manage student information such as names, ages, grades, and attendance status.
2. **Simple Calculator**: A program to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Student Management System

### Problem Statement

You need to create a JavaScript program that manages student information. This includes:

- Declaring variables to store student details.
- Assigning sample values to these variables.
- Displaying the student information.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Declare Variables

Declare variables to represent student information such as name, age, grade, and attendance status.

#### Task 2: Assign Sample Values

Assign sample values to the student information variables.

#### Task 3: Display Student Information

Use `console.log()` statements to display the values of the student information variables.

### Learning Outcomes

- **Task 1**: Learn how to declare variables with different data types in JavaScript.
- **Task 2**: Understand how to assign values to variables.
- **Task 3**: Learn how to display variable values using `console.log()` statements.

## Simple Calculator Program

### Problem Statement

Develop a simple calculator program to perform basic arithmetic operations. This includes:

- Declaring variables to store numeric values.
- Performing arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Exploring assignment operators.
- Using comparison operators to compare values.
- Applying logical operators to combine conditions.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Declare Variables

Declare variables to store two numeric values for performing arithmetic operations.

#### Task 2: Assign Sample Values

Assign sample numeric values to the variables declared in Task 1.

#### Task 3: Perform Arithmetic Operations

Perform arithmetic operations using the numeric values and display the results. The operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#### Task 4: Explore Assignment Operators

Update the values of variables using assignment operators and display the updated values.

#### Task 5: Use Comparison Operators

Compare the values of variables using comparison operators and display the results. This includes checking equality, greater than, and not equal conditions.

#### Task 6: Apply Logical Operators

Use logical operators to combine conditions and display the results. This involves checking if both numbers are positive and if at least one number is even.

### Learning Outcomes

- **Task 1 & 2**: Understand how to declare variables and assign values.
- **Task 3**: Learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations and display results.
- **Task 4**: Explore assignment operators and their use in updating variable values.
- **Task 5**: Use comparison operators to compare values and evaluate conditions.
- **Task 6**: Apply logical operators to combine conditions and evaluate logical expressions.
